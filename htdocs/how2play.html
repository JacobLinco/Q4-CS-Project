        <h3>General Instructions:</h3>
        <p>As the title suggests, this website is a trivia quiz on gaming! You
        will answer different types of items in the next page, and you will
        be ranked based on your scores. Some items may earn more points than
        others and some 'lifelines' (to be explained later) may also affect the 
        pointes gained from a question.</p>
                                         
        <h4>Item Types: </h4>

              a number. The player has to guess what this number, but there will
              be an accepted range so the guess does not have to be exact. Exact
